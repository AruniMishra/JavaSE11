## Inheritance

A method signature is made up of its name and ordered list of parameter types

An overridden method must match parameter types exactly

An overridden method must match a return type exactly or be a covariant of the return type

An overloaded method ignores parameter names

An overloaded method ignores return types

you can override a method with a throws' clause, and not declare one yourself in base case.  
you do not have to specify a throws clause in the overridden method

You can overload overridden methods.

Modifier 'static' is redundant for inner interfaces

## Abstract Class
 - An abstract class(either abstract method or concrete method) can override a method in an interface though it should be public.



## Interface

- Concrete methods are supported on an interface but limited to private methods, private static methods, default methods, and public static methods.
