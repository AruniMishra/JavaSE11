# Java

Implicit narrowing(for final constant) occurs only for byte, char, short, and int. 
Remember that it does not occur for long, float, or double.







## Inner class

Method-local inner classes cannot be defined using explicit access modifiers (public, protected and private) but non-access modifiers: final and abstract can be used with method-local inner class.
Static also not allowed.

a method local inner class can access local variables and parameters of the enclosing block that are final or effectively final.
